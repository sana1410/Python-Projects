### OBJECTIVE: -
Crab is widely regarded for its delicious taste, leading numerous countries globally to import substantial quantities of crabs annually for consumption. Crab farming offers significant advantages, notably low labor costs, relatively lower production expenses, and rapid growth rates.

The objective of this project is predict the age of the crabs based on the physical attributes like height , weight , Shell weight etc. ![Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidhus/crab-age-prediction). This model is going to help commercial crab farmer by knowing the right age of the crab which will help them  to decide if and when to harvest the crabs.
